# Godot-Prototype-Project---Platform-Movement
This repository have the basic platform movement with some features (like Hollow Knight) that make the game better to control. Some of them are, "BufferJump", "CoyoteTime", etc.
Most of the code was developed by me, but I implemented elements from other sources to perfectly replicate the mechanics.
